# Hospital-Survey-Insights

## The goal of this project is to investigate the factors that affect a hospital's satisfaction rating in order to surface reccomendations that might increase their satisfaction score in the future. 

## Dataset
The American 2022 Hospital Consumer Assessment of Hospital Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) Survey dataset and American 2020-21 hospital bed count dataset were merged to create a dataset compiling the HCAHPS Survey results for all American hospitals (smallest to largest). 

## Inisghts Summary
To figure out what affects a hospital's satisfaction rating, specific "top-box" questions from the HCAHPS Survey that ask a patient if a hospital "always" performs a good/valuable service is used to compare between the hospitals. 

### Here are the key metrics used the compare each hospital:
### -Percentage of Patients Rating the Hospital 9-10
### -Hospital Question Delta From Mean Cohort % 
### -Cohort Data Spread

### Percentage of Patients Rating the Hospital 9-10
- For top performing hospitals, 80-90% of patients give them a satisfaction score of 9 or 10
- For lower performing hospitals, 50-60% of patients give them a satisfaction score of 9 or 10 

### Hospital Question Delta From Mean Cohort
- Top performing hospitals receive better patient feedback for all/most top-box questions relative to the hospitals in their size and state cohort
- Lower performing hospitals receive worse patient feedback for all/most top-box questions relative to the hospitals in their size and state cohort

### Cohort Data Spread
- Top performing hospitals receive patient feedback that lie towards the right of the mean cohort for all/most top-box questions
- Lower performing hospitals receive patient feedback thatlie towards the left of the mean cohort for all/most top-box questions
